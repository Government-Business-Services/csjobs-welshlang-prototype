Do you want a role that will help develop your skills and leadership potential? Are you organised, a team player and inquisitive?
<br>
<br>We are looking for officers to join Investigation Hubs, a vital team in HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) that supports criminal and civil investigations by taking on a wide variety of tasks - from preparing intelligence packs to managing our vehicle fleet to procuring essential equipment for investigators.
<br>
<br>At HMRC we are committed to creating a great place to work for all our colleagues; an inclusive and respectful environment that reflects the diversity of the society we serve.
<br>
<br>We want to maximise the potential of everyone who chooses to work for us and we offer a range of flexible working patterns and support to make a fulfilling career at HMRC accessible to you.
<br>
<br>Diverse perspectives and experiences are critical to our success and we welcome applications from all people from all backgrounds with the experience and skills needed to perform our roles.
<br>
<br><b>About us:</b>
<br>
<br>HMRC is one of the largest government departments and one of the country's biggest organisations. Almost every individual and business in the United Kingdom is a direct customer of HMRC. We collect in excess of £500 billion a year in revenue from over 50 million customers across the UK.
<br>
<br>HMRC's Fraud Investigation Service (FIS) is responsible for the department's civil and criminal investigations.
<br>
<br>FIS provides HMRC with an effective investigation arm to enforce the Department's compliance policies. This enables the Department to deliver against our strategic responsibilities across all the taxes and duties HMRC administers. Our work includes tackling complex offshore evasion, international smuggling of illicit excise goods, exports of controlled weapons and technology, labour market abuses, VAT and Self-Assessment repayment frauds and a host of other attacks on the tax system.
<br>
<br>FIS is home to a wide range of people with a variety of skills and professional backgrounds - including accountants, cybercrime specialists, criminal justice professionals, tax professionals and operational delivery teams. We use a range of powers and approaches to protect funding for vital UK public services, investigating the most harmful tax cheats and ensuring nobody is beyond our reach.</div></div><div class="vac_display_field"><h3>Job description</h3><div class="vac_display_field_value">At HMRC we are committed to creating a great place to work for all our colleagues; an inclusive and respectful environment that reflects the diversity of the society we serve.

<br>
<br>Diverse perspectives and experiences are critical to our success and we welcome applications from all people from all backgrounds with the experience and skills needed to perform this role.
<br>
<br>FIS are transforming how we work to make us more effective and efficient in light of the many and pressing challenges that modern-day tax fraud presents. A significant part of our transformation will be delivered via the introduction of Investigation Hubs.
<br>
<br>The Investigation Hub Administrative Officer is a new role. Investigation Hub Administrative Officers will be responsible for delivering core services covering a variety of activities and are part of every criminal and civil investigation carried out by HMRC.
<br>
<br>They will provide excellent service to a range of customers, supporting investigations through activities such as:
<br>
<br>Interrogating departmental systems, preparing standard intelligence packs, standardising and interpreting data.
<br>
<br>Maintaining data across various HMRC systems.
<br>
<br>Procurement of essential items and management of associated budgets.
<br>
<br>Developing professional stakeholder relationships with investigators to support planning and delivery.
<br>
<br>Managing property and vehicles, as part of which you may be required to drive an official vehicle for reasons such as return of evidence, property retrieval or for vehicle maintenance / repairs.
<br>
<br>General administration.
<br>
<br>As an Investigation Hub Administrative Officer, you will play a key role in the way we operate across the whole business area.
<br>
<br>You will work as part of our team to improve productivity, quality and support in the implementation of continuous improvement and displaying a positive attitude to change. You'll use your judgement to achieve the best outcome for HMRC and take responsibility for personal performance.
<br>
<br>Learning and Development:
<br>
<br>HMRC and FIS offer a wide range of learning and career development opportunities and we encourage you to be fully engaged in your own development.
<br>
<br>Successful candidates joining HMRC and FIS will undertake mandatory learning in addition to our Learning &amp; Development offer.
<br>
<br>For example, with support, you'll learn about and develop a working knowledge of tax, specific HMRC IT systems, investigation work, intelligence gathering and law enforcement systems.
<br>
<br>Training products will be delivered via classroom-based learning, online learning, Webinars, YouTube videos, desk-based learning, mentoring and continuous learning as you develop in post.
<br>
<br>
<br>On occasion, you may be required to provide a witness statement or be called upon to provide evidence in court. In addition, out of hours working may be required on occasion to support your team.
<br>
<br>Important, this role requires a security clearance. A job offer is conditional to the attainment of Security Clearance and thus, the security clearance is mandatory.
<br>
<br>Please note: The reason we are launching this recruitment campaign across all locations is to ensure we have sufficient resources available for the future to cover our recruitment needs for the next 12 months. Candidates will be asked for location preferences in their application. Where this is not a role available in a specific location, candidates will be placed on a merit list for future opportunities.
<br>
<br>Successful candidates will occasionally need to attend our vehicle location centres which are up to 30 minutes journey time from the regional centre.<br><br><h3>Responsibilities</h3>As an Investigation Hub Administrative Officer, you will play a key role in the way we operate across the whole business area.

<br><b>Security Update</b>
<br>
<br>If you are successful and transferring from another Government Department, we will carry out a check of your identity, nationality, and immigration status (including the right to work in the UK) and a criminal record check before confirming your appointment.
<br>
<br>Successful candidates must pass a Disclosure and Barring Security Check or Disclosure Scotland or Access NI. Please note that HMRC have an exemption under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, which enables us to make enquiries about both unspent and spent convictions.
<br>
<br>In order to process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service  or Disclosure Scotland or Access NI on your behalf. However, we recognise in exceptional circumstances some candidates will want to send their completed forms direct. If you will be doing this, please advise Government Recruitment Service of your intention by emailing Pre-EmploymentChecks.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk stating the job reference number in the subject heading.
<br>
<br>For further information on the Disclosure Scotland confidential checking service telephone: the Disclosure Scotland Helpline on 0870 609 6006 and ask to speak to the operations manager in confidence, or email Info@disclosurescotland.co.uk
<br>
<br>For further information on the Access NI confidential checking service telephone: the Access NI Helpline on 0300 200 7888 and ask to speak to the operations manager in confidence, or email accessni@ani.x.gsi.gov.uk
<br>
<br>Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD). This check will provide information about employees who have been dismissed for fraud or dishonesty offences. This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicant's details held on the IFD will be refused employment.
<br>
<br>A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.
<br>
<br>Please note: in addition to the standard pre-employment checks for appointment into the Civil Service, all candidates must also obtain National Security Vetting at Security Check (SC) clearance level for this vacancy. You will normally need to meet the minimum UK residency period as determined by the level of vetting being undertaken, which for SC is 5 years UK residency prior to your vetting application. If you have any questions about this residency requirement, please speak to the vacancy holder for this post.
<br>
<br><b>HMRC transformation</b>
<br>
<br>HM Revenue and Customs is currently going through an exciting ten-year transformation programme to create a tax authority fit for the future. As part of this, we are committed to providing high-quality jobs and giving employees a great place to work, whichever location you work from.
<br>
<br>HM Revenue and Customs has made significant progress with its plans to locate in 13 large, modern, flexible offices, equipped with high-speed digital infrastructure supporting improved customer service and compliance activity. These collaborative workspaces will enable smarter working and great training and development facilities, allowing for the sharing of expertise, local training, promotion, and provide great ongoing career development opportunities.
<br>
<br>These offices will be located in central locations in the following towns and cities close to accessible transport links: Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast, Newcastle, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Croydon and Stratford.
<br>In addition, there will also be a small number of specialist sites where the work cannot be done anywhere else, in Gartcosh (near Glasgow), Telford, Ipswich, Worthing and Dover, as well as our headquarters in central London. What's more, our Welsh language service has people located in Porthmadog, as well as Cardiff.
<br>
<br>We are letting you know about our future plans because if you are recruited into an office that is not one of these locations, you will be expected, subject to HM Revenue and Customs applicable policies, to move to one of these locations in the future. In some cases, this will be via one of our nine transitional sites.
<br>
<br>For more information please contact the vacancy holder.
<br>
<br><b>Terms and Conditions</b>
<br>
<br>We really hope you decide to apply for this role. If you're successful you need to know that in February 2021 members of recognised trade unions (ARC and PCS) voted to approve a pay and contract reform offer. This means that HMRC will adopt new terms and conditions for all colleagues as part of a multi-year pay deal and contract offer, the pay deal period is 01 June 2020 - 31st May 2023 and terms and conditions changes take place from the 01 June 2021 onwards. These terms will apply to colleagues who already work in HMRC and if you join us, it will apply to you too. We've put together a summary of the key changes that will be made and you can find this attached to the Job Advert.
<br>
<br><b>Pay</b>
<br>
<br>If you are currently working for an OGD and would like to consider the impact on your pay when joining HMRC, please see the attached document "Pay on Transfer from OGD" for further information. (Please note the attached document could also be called "Combined T&amp;C and OGD Pay English")
<br>
<br>New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.
<br>
<br><b>Further Information</b>
<br>
<br>Customer facing roles in HMRC require the ability to converse at ease with members of the public and provide advice in accurate spoken English and/or Welsh where required. Where this is an essential requirement this will be tested as part of the selection process.
<br>
<br>A reserve list may be held for a period of 12 months from which further appointments can be made.
<br>
<br>Any move to HMRC from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may however be eligible for other government schemes, including Tax Free Childcare. Determine your eligibility <a href="https://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk/" rel="external">here</a>
<br>
<br>HMRC welcomes applications from those who need to work a more flexible arrangement and will agree to requests where possible, taking into account our operational and customer service needs. We can't guarantee that we can meet all requests to work flexibly, as agreement will be subject to business ability to accommodate, and any request to work a more flexible arrangement should be made prior to your acceptance of the provisional offer.
<br>
<br>If you are experiencing accessibility problems with any attachments on this advert, please contact the email address in the 'Contact point for applicants' section.
<br>
<br><b>Reasonable adjustment</b>
<br>
<br>We want to make sure no one is put at a disadvantage during our recruitment process because of a disability, condition or impairment. To assist you with this, we will reduce or remove any barriers where possible and provide additional support where appropriate. Please see our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-for-hmrc-information-for-applicants" rel="external">Disability Matters: How we can support you during our selection process booklet</a> for more details.
